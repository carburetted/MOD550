Classes and data generation

Classes can be manipulated in very different ways. This is very useful when handling data from different source with different properties.

Here an example on how to generate data in classes, and work on the data directly via their classes.
Exercise: make a 2D random data plot and one with noise around a linear function

Exercise: Let's make it more pythonic, part 1: into function

Exercise: Let's be even more pythonic now, keep the data and the functions inside a class

Exercise: Add different data coming from different distributions

Exercise: add a function to the class such to generate linear data and sum then a class with random data
